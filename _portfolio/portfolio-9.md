## Project Overview

As part of Google Summer of Code 2025, I worked on enhancing the MLPCpp module in SU2, the open-source CFD framework. My contributions focused on:

 - Integrating the Tracy profiler for low-overhead performance analysis.
 - Optimizing variable mapping with hash maps to reduce runtime overhead.
 - Refactoring neural network evaluation code, achieving a 1.3Ã— speedup in tests.
 - Further details, including implementation notes, benchmarks, and future work, are available in my full [project summary](https://gist.github.com/divyaprakash-iitd/998eaf88bcc1b1325c29a53dca8a3e91)
