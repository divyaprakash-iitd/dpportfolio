## Project Overview
Droplet growth and size spectra play a crucial role in the microphysics of atmospheric clouds. However, it is challenging to represent droplet growth rate accurately in cloud-resolving models such as Large Eddy Simulations (LESs). To overcome the limitations of the "well-mixed" assumption in traditional LES solvers, this project proposes a parameterization for superdroplet growth using high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data. A novel clustering algorithm maps droplets in DNS fields to superdroplets, and a machine learning model is developed to relate the effective growth rate of these superdroplets to filtered DNS flow variables.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Ingests and transforms raw Lagrangian and Eulerian data from DNS simulations into a structured format for machine learning.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implements multiple scaling methods to extract and prepare features and labels for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains and validates a model to predict the effective supersaturation for superdroplets, achieving a promising R² value of nearly 0.9.
- **A Posteriori Analysis**: Includes scripts for evaluating the model's performance and generalization on unseen data.
- **Modular Workflow**: The project is organized into distinct stages: post-processing, training, and a posteriori analysis.

## Technical Details
